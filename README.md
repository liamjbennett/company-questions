#Company Questions
After having seen several people fumble at the end of the interview to ask questions about the company and also having been that candiate with a rough piece of papper in my back pocket I decided to compile a list of question that I find useful to ask any future employeer.

This is very much aimed at those of us in Agile/DevOps roles. You may decide to select the a couple to ask at the end of the interview process or you may (if appropriate) ask your employeer for answers on all of them.

I have split this up into 4 sections: Compnay, Product, Process and Tools - the order is deliberate and based upon the level of importance that I give to each. I will attempt to add useful descriptions to each question so that you can understand the motivation for asking it.
